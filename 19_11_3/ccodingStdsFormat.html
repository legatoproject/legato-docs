Multiple Inclusion Guards</h1>
<p>In order to prevent multiple declaration errors due to multiple inclusion of the same header file, every header file must include a "multiple inclusion guard" of this form:</p>
<pre class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#ifndef UNIQUE_INCLUDE_GUARD</span></div><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#define UNIQUE_INCLUDE_GUARD</span></div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line">...</div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line">#endif</div></pre><!-- fragment --><p><code>"UNIQUE_INCLUDE_GUARD"</code> must be replaced with a macro name that is certain to be unique to this header file. To ensure this uniqueness, the macro name should contain the name of the file (converted to all upper case, with underscores separating words), be prefixed with a name or abbreviation that is unique to the module that the header file is a part of, have <code>"_INCLUDE_GUARD"</code> as a suffix.</p>
<p>For example, the "Converter" module's inter-module interface file "converter.h" in the Sierra Wireless (SWI) "Transmogrifier" component could contain a multiple inclusion guard macro named like this:</p>
<p><code>SWI_TMOG_CONVERTER_INCLUDE_GUARD</code> No code (other than comments) in a header file may reside outside of that file's multiple inclusion guard. For example:</p>
<pre class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">// Only comments allowed here.</span></div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#ifndef SWI_TMOG_CONVERTER_INCLUDE_GUARD</span></div><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#define SWI_TMOG_CONVERTER_INCLUDE_GUARD</span></div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// Any code can go here.</span></div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#endif // SWI_TMOG_CONVERTER_INCLUDE_GUARD</span></div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// Only comments allowed here, but preferably nothing but the end of file should be here.</span></div></pre><!-- fragment --><p>To allow these include guard macros to be renamed (in case the file is renamed, the code changes hands, a naming conflict is found, etc.) and to avoid confusing future maintainers, these macros should not be used for anything else other than the multiple inclusion guard.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>When modifying pre-existing code that contains multiple-inclusion guards, use the multiple-inclusion guard style of the pre-existing code, rather than using our style of multiple-inclusion guard.</dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatingLineLength"></a>
Line Length</h1>
<p>Lines of code should not be longer than 100 columns.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="codingPreExistingCode"></a>
Pre-Existing Code</h1>
<p>When modifying pre-existing code, the style of the pre-existing code should be used over any of the standards listed below. However, even when modifying pre-existing code, the standards listed above still apply to those parts that you modify. Although, you would not be expected to rewrite a complex pre-existing function just because you made a very small change to it.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatNaming"></a>
Naming</h1>
<p>Naming is arguably one of the most important aspects of coding. The impact that naming has on readability (and therefore reviewability and maintainability) cannot be understated. Extra time spent on choosing the right names or correcting poor naming is almost certainly going to pay back several times over in future savings of time and effort in peer reviews, testing, troubleshooting, and renovations (refactoring, re-engineering, and design and implementation of new requirements).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatNamingDescriptive"></a>
Be Descriptive</h2>
<p>The most important requirement for names of identifiers, files, etc. is that they describe what they are. Don't call a pointer to a timer "p", or "tp" (is that toilet paper?). Call it "timerPtr". At a glance, it's extremely obvious what a "timerPtr" is.</p>
<p>It is, however, acceptable for loop counters to be numbered simply "i" (or "j" for a nested loop, or "k" for a nested nested loop), because these are common usages, not only in programming, but also in mathematics.</p>
<p>It is also acceptable for variables with very limited scope (i.e., limited to a handful of lines of code) to have very simplified names, if that improves readability through the reduction of clutter. For example, "t" becomes more acceptable for a timer reference if it is used in a tiny code block, such as the following:</p>
<pre class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keywordtype">void</span> StartTimer(<span class="keywordtype">void</span>)</div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">    <a class="code" href="le__timer_8h.html#a763fa6992488cdce3b5a820817094838">le_timer_Ref_t</a> t = <a class="code" href="le__timer_8h.html#aee41169a210378b369f440cf99146522">le_timer_Create</a>(TimerPool);</div><div class="line">    <a class="code" href="le__timer_8h.html#a0a103d5cef5e83fc9088859d527bbd43">le_timer_SetInterval</a>(t, TIMER_INTERVAL);</div><div class="line">    le_timer_SetExpiryHandler(t, TimerExpired, NULL);</div><div class="line">    <a class="code" href="le__timer_8h.html#ada2ce7f8cb1e76ed959e323ae94bbfc0">le_timer_Start</a>(t);</div><div class="line">}</div></pre><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatNamingPrefixes"></a>
Prefixes</h2>
<p>Often, an identifier prefix is needed to prevent naming conflicts between identifiers that are exported to other modules as a part of an interface. For example, two interfaces may each define a function called "GetSize". To prevent naming conflicts (and to avoid programmer confusion), each of those interfaces prefixes its "GetSize" function identifier with its own, unique prefix. Of course, these prefixes are also needed for other things besides functions: types, variables, files, and macros. This section defines the general structure of these prefixes, while other sections define the specific prefixing rules for types, variables, functions, etc.</p>
<p>The structure of an interface-specific prefix differs based on the scope of the interface. The possible scopes are:</p><ul>
<li>inter-component - an interface implemented by one component and used by other components</li>
<li>inter-module - and interface implemented by one module and used by other modules within the same component.</li>
</ul>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Inter-module interfaces could also be called intra-component interfaces, but "intra" looks and sounds too much like "inter", so "inter-module" is the preferred term.</dd></dl>
<p>Each part of the prefix must start with a lower case letter (unless it is a macro prefix) and must be separated from other parts of the identifier using underscores. Underscores are used instead of capitalization to separate the parts of the prefix and to separate the prefix from the identifier for several reasons:</p><ul>
<li>To make the prefix visibly stand out clearly from the rest of the identifier.</li>
<li>Because abbreviations tend to often be acronyms, which sometimes get capitalized improperly when using camel case.</li>
<li>To make machine parsing of these identifiers easier.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="codingNamingPrefixInterCompInt"></a>
Inter-Component Interfaces</h3>
<p>Inter-component interfaces have prefixes containing at least two parts:</p><ul>
<li>company abbreviation</li>
<li>interface name abbreviation</li>
</ul>
<p>The company abbreviation indicates what company the interface belongs to. For interfaces owned by Sierra Wireless, this could be "swi". For open-source projects, the abbreviation would indicate which project the interface belongs to. For example, interfaces defined as part of the "Legato AF" project could start with "le_".</p>
<p>The interface name abbreviation is simply an abbreviation of the interface's name. For example, a "memory management API" might have <code>mem</code> as its abbreviation. This abbreviation should not be longer than 5 characters. <b>Two</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> characters is preferred.</p>
<p>So, for example, a timer API owned by Sierra Wireless might have the prefix <code>swi_tmr:</code> </p>
<pre class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="keyword">struct </span>swi_tmr* swi_tmr_Ref_t;</div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line">swi_tmr_Ref_t swi_tmr_Create(<span class="keywordtype">void</span>);</div><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">void</span> swi_tmr_SetInterval(swi_tmr_Ref_t timer, uint32_t intervalInMs);</div><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">void</span> swi_tmr_Start(swi_tmr_Ref_t timer);</div><div class="line">...</div><div class="line">while the Legato Memory Management API could have the prefix <span class="stringliteral">"le_mem"</span>.</div><div class="line">typedef <span class="keyword">struct </span>le_mem_Pool* <a class="code" href="le__mem_8h.html#a44a896f6a0a1a8c733e8038eb332989e">le_mem_PoolRef_t</a>;</div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line">le_mem_PoolRef_t <a class="code" href="le__mem_8h.html#a4209efb432b004dbda733d541acc9ee0">le_mem_CreatePool</a>(<span class="keywordtype">size_t</span> blockSizeInBytes);</div></pre><!-- fragment --><h3><a class="anchor" id="codingNamingIntModInt"></a>
Inter-Module Interfaces</h3>
<p>Inter-module interfaces have only one part to their prefix: an interface name abbreviation. For example, a "Registration List" module may use the prefix <code>rlist_</code>, while a "Registration" module, which implements the Registration objects that get stored in the Registration List might use the prefix <code>reg_:</code> </p>
<pre class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">void</span> rlist_Add(reg_Ref_t registration);</div><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">void</span> rlist_Remove(reg_Ref_t registration);</div><div class="line">reg_Ref_t rlist_FindByName(<span class="keyword">const</span> <span class="keywordtype">char</span>* name);</div></pre><!-- fragment --><p>Because inter-module interfaces are not seen outside of the component in which they are defined, it is impossible to have a naming conflict between an inter-module interface in one component and an inter-module interface in another component (Actually, there could still be a conflict at the link stage, if the symbols are allowed to leak out, but a linker script file can be used to prevent this quite easily). Furthermore, because all interfaces imported from outside a component will have both a company prefix and an interface name abbreviation, it is impossible to have a naming conflict between an inter-component interface and an inter-module interface. The difference in the prefixes also highlights the scope differences of the identifiers, which can be very significant to those who have to read the code someday. That is, someone looking at a piece of code can easily see whether there is coupling with other components or just other modules within the same component.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatNamingFiles"></a>
Files</h2>
<p>As with other forms of identifiers, the most important requirement for file names is that they must be descriptive. e.g., the name of the file must clearly describe what the file contains.</p>
<p>Also important, however, is that files must be named in such a way that their names will not conflict with the names of other files. This is mainly important for include files. For example, don't call one of your header files "time.h", because that name will conflict with the C standard library file of the same name. To this end, inter-component interface headers must be prefixed with the company abbreviation as described above. (For example, the Sierra Wireless "Transmogrify" API include file could be named something like "swi_transmog.h".) But, prefixes are not required on files that are only visible within a limited scope (e.g., implementation files or inter-module interfaces only visible inside a single software component).</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatNamingMacros"></a>
Macros</h2>
<p>Macros can be used in similar ways to variables and functions, but their behavior has subtle differences that can result in bugs or code bloat if used incorrectly. Compiler errors and warnings resulting from macro substitution can also be somewhat cryptic and difficult to understand if it isn't obvious that the code involved is a macro. Therefore, it is important to be able to easily distinguish visually a macro from a non-macro when reading code. To this end, macro names must be all uppercase, with words separated using underscores.</p>
<p>Names of macros can also conflict with the names of macros defined in include files from other modules. To reduce the chances of a naming conflict, any macros exported to other modules must have a prefix, and even macros only used within a single file should have a prefix if the names are likely to conflict with names defined in standard C libraries and other included code that doesn't use prefixes. Prefix rules are defined above.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="codingNamingTypes"></a>
Types</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatNamingTypesSuffix"></a>
Suffix</h3>
<p>Types are distinctly different from instances, and yet it is possible to name them such that it can be hard to tell whether something is a type or a variable when reading the code. Furthermore, naming conflicts can occur between types and variables and even between types and functions. To prevent these sorts of issues, type names are always given an "_t" suffix.</p>
<p>codingFormatNamingTypesPrefix Prefix</p>
<p>If a type is defined in a header file, there's the possibility that its name may conflict with the name of another type defined elsewhere. To prevent such conflicts, all types that are defined inside header files must have a prefix as defined above. Types that are defined inside implementation (.c) files don't need such a prefix. They have file scope, and imported types will have prefixes, so naming conflicts are highly unlikely. The prefix (if any) must be all lower-case.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatNamingTypesName"></a>
Name</h3>
<p>After the prefix (if any), the rest of the type name must be in CamelCase, beginning with an uppercase character.</p>
<pre class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">// Inside a .c file:</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="keywordtype">size_t</span> ObjectCount_t;</div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// Inside the Sierra Wireless "Foo" component's API .h file:</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="keywordtype">size_t</span> swi_foo_ObjectCount_t;</div></pre><!-- fragment --><h3><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatNamingCardinalTypes"></a>
Cardinal Types</h3>
<p>Cardinal types (e.g., int, uint, int32, bool) are exempt from having a prefix or suffix because naming a variable <code>bool</code> or <code>int</code> would not be very descriptive, so there's little point in trying to avoid such naming conflicts.</p>
<p>Most cardinal types are built into the language and we are not allowed to change their names (nor would we want to -- imagine the confusion and the 3rd-party integration problems!).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatNamingEnumMembers"></a>
Enumeration Members</h3>
<p>Enumeration members are constants that are used in a very similar way to macro constants. To clearly identify them as literal constants, they must be named using all upper-case with underscores separating words.</p>
<p>Also like macros, names of enumeration members can also conflict with the names of macros and enumeration members defined in include files from other modules. To reduce the chances of a naming conflict, any members of enumerations exported to other modules must have a prefix, and even members of enumerations only used within a single file should have a prefix if the names are likely to conflict with names defined in standard C libraries and other included code that doesn't use prefixes. Prefix rules are defined above.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatNamingStructUnionName"></a>
Struct and Union Namespaces</h3>
<p>When a structure or union is defined, it's possible to give a name to that structure or union within a separate namespace. In the following example, <code>MessageBody</code> and <code>Message</code> are in the union and struct namespaces, but <code>MessageBody_t</code> and <code>Message_t</code> are not:</p>
<pre class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="keyword">union </span>MessageBody</div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">    Request_t request;</div><div class="line">    Response_t response;</div><div class="line">}</div><div class="line">MessageBody_t;</div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="keyword">struct </span>Message</div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">    MessageType_t type;</div><div class="line">    MessageBody_t body;</div><div class="line">}</div><div class="line">Message_t;</div></pre><!-- fragment --><p>All uses of a name in the struct namespace must be preceded by the keyword "struct". Likewise, all uses of a name in the union namespace must be preceded by the keyword "union". Because these identifiers always appear with "struct" or "union" right before them, there is no confusion as to whether they are types, variables or functions; and because they are in a separate namespace, there's no possibility of naming conflicts with identifiers outside of the struct and union namespaces. Therefore, these names are exempt from having an "_t" suffix. However, if these are defined in a header file, they still must have a prefix to prevent naming conflicts with other identifiers defined by other components in the same namespace.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatNamingStructUnionMbmr"></a>
Structure and Union Members</h3>
<p>The names of members of structures and unions must start with a lower-case letter and use camel case to separate words. Because structure and union member names are always used in context (in a dereference expression), there is no confusing them with other types' members (assuming the structure or union reference identifier is well named). Therefore, no prefix is needed on structure or union member names.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="keyword">struct</span></div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">    <span class="keywordtype">char</span>* textBufferPtr;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keywordtype">int</span>   textLength;</div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line">    ...</div><div class="line">}</div><div class="line">MyStructure_t;</div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keywordtype">void</span> PrintTextBuffer(MyStructure_t* objectPtr)</div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">    <span class="keywordtype">int</span> i;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keywordflow">for</span> (i = 0; i &lt; objectPtr-&gt;textLength; i++)</div><div class="line">    {</div><div class="line">        PrintChar(objectPtr-&gt;textBufferPtr[i]);</div><div class="line">    }</div><div class="line">}</div></pre><!-- fragment --><dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Only stack variable names and struct/union member names can (and must) start with lower-case letters.</dd></dl>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatNamingFunctions"></a>
Functions</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatNamingFunctionsPrefix"></a>
Prefix</h3>
<p>If a function is defined in a header file, there's the possibility that its name may conflict with the name of another function defined elsewhere. To prevent such conflicts, all functions defined inside header files must have a prefix as defined above.</p>
<p>Functions that are defined inside implementation (.c) files don't need an inter-component or inter-module prefix. Functions defined inside .c files have file scope and any imported functions will have inter-component or inter-module prefixes, so naming conflicts are highly unlikely.</p>
<p>In addition, if a function belongs to a specific type of object (i.e., class) in an object oriented interface, its prefix must have an additional object name part. The object name part of a prefix must start with a lowercase letter and must be separated from other parts of the identifier using underscores. If the object name is made up of multiple words, they must be separated using capitalization of the first letter of the second and subsequent words in the object name (e.g., "ipRoute" or "simCard").</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="fragment"><div class="line">pool = <a class="code" href="le__mem_8h.html#a4209efb432b004dbda733d541acc9ee0">le_mem_CreatePool</a>(<span class="keyword">sizeof</span>(MyObject_t), <span class="stringliteral">"My objects"</span>);  <span class="comment">// This function doesn't belong to a class.</span></div><div class="line">le_mem_pool_Expand(pool, numObjects);  <span class="comment">// This is one of the "pool" class's functions.</span></div><div class="line">objPtr = le_mem_pool_Alloc(pool); <span class="comment">// This also belongs to the "pool" class.</span></div><div class="line">objSize = le_mem_block_GetSize(objPtr);  <span class="comment">// This function belongs to the "block" class.</span></div></pre><!-- fragment --><h3><a class="anchor" id="codingNamingFunctionCC"></a>
Camel Case</h3>
<p>After the prefix (if any), the rest of the function name should be in CamelCase, starting with an uppercase letter.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="codingNamingFunctionVerbage"></a>
Verbage</h3>
<p>Function names must contain a verb, because they are active. They should also contain an object, unless the object is obvious in the prefix.</p>
<p>To be consistent with Java conventions, the verb should come before the object.</p>
<p>Examples are: <code>GetTimeRemaining()</code>, <code><a class="el" href="le__mem_8h.html#a4209efb432b004dbda733d541acc9ee0">le_mem_CreatePool()</a></code>, and <code>swi_timer_Start()</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally, functions that return boolean results should be named as a question, for example <code>le_net_IsOnLine()</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatNamingVarFunction"></a>
Variables and Function Parameters</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="codingNamingVarFunctionCC"></a>
Camel Case</h3>
<p>Variable names and function parameter names should be in CamelCase.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="codingNamingVarFunctionVerb"></a>
Verbage</h3>
<p>Boolean type variables should be named as a question, for example:</p>
<pre class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keywordtype">bool</span> IsInitialized = <span class="keyword">false</span>;</div></pre><!-- fragment --><h3><a class="anchor" id="codingNamingVarFunctionPre"></a>
Prefix</h3>
<p>Variables are never defined inside header files, and therefore they never need prefixes.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="codingNamingVarFunctionPointers"></a>
Pointers</h3>
<p>Pointers are used very differently than non-pointer variables. Not only does a range of new operators become available for use with pointers, but mathematical operations take on a whole new meaning when used with pointers. As a result, it is important to distinguish pointer variables from non-pointer variables. Therefore, the names of pointer variables must end in <code>Ptr</code>.</p>
<pre class="fragment"><div class="line"> <span class="keywordtype">int</span> index = 0;</div><div class="line"><span class="keywordtype">int</span>* indexPtr = &amp;index;</div></pre><!-- fragment --><p>There is an exception when working with opaque types. This is because pointers are often used to implement opaque types in C. For example, a header file might contain something like this:</p>
<pre class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">typedef</span> <span class="keyword">struct </span>foo_Sandwich* foo_SandwichRef_t; </div></pre><!-- fragment --><p>This defines a type that can be used to refer to a "Sandwich" object. Note that struct foo_Sandwich is never defined outside of the "foo" module (and may not even be defined inside of the foo module). Therefore, to all outsiders, this reference looks like a pointer to an incomplete type and cannot be dereferenced. Inside the "foo" module, struct foo_Sandwich could be defined or this pointer type could even be used to hold an integer, a char, or anything else that is the same size or smaller than a pointer. For example, a "file reference" could be implemented on some systems as an integer file descriptor. In these cases, because the reference is an opaque type that is never used as a pointer by anyone outside of the module that implements it, and because it might not be a pointer at all even inside the module that implements it, variables of opaque pointer types don't need a <code>Ptr</code> suffix.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatNamingStackVar"></a>
Stack Variables</h3>
<p>Variables that exist on the stack are function parameters and "automatic variables" (non-static variables declared inside of functions). When these variables go out of scope, they disappear. That is, their memory is released to be later used for other purposes. To make it obvious that these variables are stack variables and not static variables, they must start with a lower-case letter. Because the scope of these variables is limited to within a specific function or compound block within a function, they need not have a prefix to avoid naming conflicts with variables in other scopes.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keywordtype">void</span> Function(<span class="keywordtype">int</span> numericParameter)</div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">    <span class="keywordtype">char</span>* stringAutoVariable;</div><div class="line">    ...</div><div class="line">}</div></pre><!-- fragment --><dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Only stack variable names and struct/union member names can (and must) start with lower-case letters.</dd></dl>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatNamingStaticVar"></a>
Static Variables</h3>
<p>Static variables are not stored in either the stack or the heap. They are statically allocated in the data segment of the process's address space. Furthermore, they have scope limited to either a compound statement (if defined inside a function), or a file (if defined outside of all functions). Because these variables are never visible outside of a file, they don't need any special prefix to prevent naming conflicts with variables from other files. But, because they are stored differently than variables on the stack (and don't disappear when they go out of scope), they start with an upper-case letter to distinguish them from stack variables.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keywordtype">int</span> CallCounter = 0;  <span class="comment">// This is a file-scope variable.</span></div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keywordtype">void</span> Function(<span class="keywordtype">int</span> numericParameter)</div><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keywordtype">bool</span> WasCalledBefore = FALSE;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keywordtype">char</span>* stringAutoVariable;</div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line">    <span class="keywordflow">if</span> (!WasCalledBefore)</div><div class="line">    {</div><div class="line">        ...</div><div class="line">        WasCalledBefore = TRUE;</div><div class="line">    }</div><div class="line"> </div><div class="line">    CallCounter++;</div><div class="line">    ...</div><div class="line">}</div></pre><!-- fragment --><h2><a class="anchor" id="codingFormatAbbrv"></a>
Abbreviations</h2>
<p>In the interests of having manageable-length identifiers, developers often abbreviate words when constructing identifiers. Unfortunately, if these abbreviations are not carefully chosen, they can often create confusion.</p>
<p>Following is a list of acceptable abbreviations (in alphabetical order of abbreviated word). Other abbreviations should be created with care and consideration for readability and prevailing norms. </p><dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>This list is still a work-in-progress. Please feel free to propose additions to it.</dd></dl>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="codingCommenting"></a>
Commenting</h1>
<p>If anything not completely obvious is going on, it must be documented clearly using comments. To ensure clarity, comments should be free of spelling and grammar mistakes. This is especially important as most of the comments in interface files (.h, .api, .etc) are made available to the public through external documentation.</p>
<p>Comments should also be used to improve readability, wherever appropriate. However, there's no point in commenting the obvious, like this:</p>
<pre class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">// Set the flag</span></div><div class="line">isReady = TRUE;</div></pre><!-- fragment --><p>Comments should focus mainly on the <b>why</b>, as opposed to the what or the how. The code should be written in such a way that what the code is doing and how it is doing it is obvious given how nicely named the identifiers are and how cleanly structured the code is. If it isn't, please consider rewriting the code. If rewriting it to make the what and how more obvious is not practical, then do please comment the what and the how, but rewriting for clarity of the code is preferred.</p>
<p>What cannot often be conveyed in the code itself is why the code is doing what it is doing. This is the most valuable information to have in comments, since it can shine light on pitfalls and help quickly identify whether design change options are viable. Often, the why was learned the hard way, so documenting it can save others from having to learn it the hard way too. Also, sometimes things are done arbitrarily, which is good to know too so people don't have to fear that making changes to it might break something in some subtle way.</p>
<p>C++ style comments are permitted in C code. All modern compilers which implement the C99 standard support them.</p>
<p>Each module should contain a module comment block at the top of the file that describes the module's purpose. The header comment block should be formatted like this:</p>
<pre class="fragment">/**
 * @file le_basics.h
 *
 * There are certain cardinal types and commonly-used constants that form the most basic
 * foundation upon which everything else is built.  These include things such as
 * error codes, portable integer types, and helpful macros to make ugly things nicer to
 * look at and easier to use.
 *
 * Copyright (C) Sierra Wireless Inc.
 */
</pre><dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>See Copyright Notices for information regarding the copyright notice in the file header.</dd></dl>
<p>Each function should be preceded by a comment block that describes the purpose of the function, its possible return values and any side effects that it may have. The function blocks should be formatted like this:</p>
<pre class="fragment">//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Creates a sub-pool.
 *
 * See @ref sub_pools for more information.
 *
 * @return
 *      A reference to the sub-pool.
 */
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
le_mem_PoolRef_t le_mem_CreateSubPool
(
    le_mem_PoolRef_t    pool,       ///&lt; [IN] The super-pool.
    const char*         name,       ///&lt; [IN] The name of the sub-pool (will be copied
                                    ///  into the sub-pool).
    size_t              numObjects  ///&lt; [IN] The number of objects to take from the
                                    ///  super-pool.
);
</pre><p>Function parameters should be documented with comments after the parameter as shown in the example above. Placing the comments after the parameters as opposed to in the function comment block keeps the comments and parameters together and makes the comments either to read. It also serves as a reminder to the developer to update the comments when the parameters are changed.</p>
<p>The function description must follow the following template:</p>
<pre class="fragment">//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/**
* My function description.
*
* @return
*  - LE_OK on success
*  - LE_FAULT on failure
*/
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre><p>And not:</p>
<pre class="fragment">//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/**
* My function description.
*
* @return LE_OK on success
* @return LE_FAULT on failure
*/
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@endvabatim

A struct should be documented in a similar manner where each field has comments proceeding it, for
example:

@verbatim
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/**
 * List of memory pool statistics.
 */
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
typedef struct
{
    uint64_t    numAllocs;      ///&lt; The number of times an object has been allocated from this pool.
    size_t      numFree;        ///&lt; The number of free objects currently available in this pool.
    size_t      numOverflows;   ///&lt; The number of times le_mem_ForceAlloc() had to expand the pool.
}
le_mem_PoolStats_t;
</pre><p>Enumerated types should also be documented in a similar manner.</p>
<pre class="fragment">//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Standard result codes.
 *
 * @note All error codes are negative integers, thereby allowing functions returning signed
 *       integers to return non-negative values when successful or standard error codes on failure.
 */
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
typedef enum
{
    LE_OK = 0,              ///&lt; Successful.
    LE_NOT_FOUND = -1,      ///&lt; The referenced item does not exist or could not be found.
    LE_NOT_POSSIBLE = -2,   ///&lt; It is not possible to perform the requested action.
    LE_OUT_OF_RANGE = -3,   ///&lt; An index or other value is out of range.
    LE_NO_MEMORY = -4,      ///&lt; Insufficient memory is available.
    LE_NOT_PERMITTED = -5,  ///&lt; Current user does not have permission to perform requested action.
    LE_FAULT = -6,          ///&lt; Unspecified internal error.
    LE_COMM_ERROR = -7,     ///&lt; Communications error.
    LE_TIMEOUT = -8,        ///&lt; A time-out occurred.
    LE_OVERFLOW = -9,       ///&lt; An overflow occurred or would have occurred.
    LE_WOULD_BLOCK = -10,   ///&lt; Would have blocked if non-blocking behaviour was not requested.
}
le_result_t;
</pre><p>However, if the meaning of the constants in an enumerated type are obvious from their names the comments may be omitted as in the following example:</p>
<pre class="fragment">//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Colour type.
 */
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
static typedef enum
{
    RED = 0,
    YELLOW = 1,
    GREEN = 2
}
Colour_t;
</pre><h1><a class="anchor" id="codingCopyrightNotices"></a>
Copyright Notices</h1>
<p>In countries that are treaty members of the Berne Convention (including France, the U.S., Canada and China), copyright is immediately and automatically assigned as soon as a work is created. There is no legal requirement to explicitly state copyright ownership in order for copyright to be valid. However, it is best to be clear about who owns copyright on a work and what permissions they grant to others with respect to that work, to avoid misconceptions.</p>
<p>The following statement must be included in every source file:</p>
<pre class="fragment">Copyright (C) Sierra Wireless Inc.
</pre><p>In addition, if a source code file is to be released outside of Sierra Wireless under licence (whether open-source or proprietary), a file containing the full license terms must be included in the source code distribution package (e.g., CD, zip file, public version control system directory, etc.), and that file must be named such that it is obvious that it contains the license (e.g., "LICENSE.txt").</p>
<p>Ideally, every file should contain a reference to the specific licence that it has been released under. That can be pasted in-line in the file, if it is a short licence, or it can be referred to by name and active Internet-accessible URL. But, this is not mandatory, unless required by the source code license.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>If the copyright symbol cannot be easily inserted because of the editor or character set being used, then (C) should be used in its place.</dd></dl>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="codingSeparation"></a>
Separation of Interface from Implementation</h1>
<p>Header files should contain only interface details. Implementation details should appear only in <code></code>.c files.</p>
<p>The separation of interface from implementation reduces coupling, which increases quality.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="codingInterfaceDocs"></a>
Interface Documentation</h1>
<p>Inter-component interfaces should be documented using Doxygen. This allows documentation pages to be written right inside the include (.h) files.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="codingTabs"></a>
Tabs</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, tab characters are not handled in a consistent way in editors and browsers. Some put tab stops at the equivalent of 8 spaces, others use 4 and, albeit rarely, other distances are sometimes used as well. As a result, source code containing tab characters are not rendered properly in all cases.</p>
<p>Tab characters must be avoided in C source code. Spaces must be used to indent lines C code, instead.</p>
<p>The standard indentation distance is 4 spaces per indentation level.</p>
<p>Configure your editor(s) now! (...and, while you're at it, tell your editor not to automatically go and change pre-existing code.)</p>
